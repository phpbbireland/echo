# Keyboard PCB's
A repository for Keyboard PCB's Kicad Files.

**Basic Keyboard PCB**  
A basic Keyboard should include:  
+ Hot-Swappable MX Connectors,
+ Diodes,
+ RBG Leds, 
+ Rotart Encoder
+ A connector to connect to a development module (processor) such as RP2040 or BlackPill.

All my Basic Keeyboards use a 34 pin 1.27mm connector (see images)...

Includes: 
+ A range of Basic Keyboard PCB's
+ Number Pad with Macros and Rotary Encoder
+ A 60% keyboard with 6 macro keys (inspired by my AKKO M1)...
+ A 80% keyboard with 12 macro keys...

Above boards work with any development modules but were designed to work with my RP2040 Keyboard Development Module V2...
