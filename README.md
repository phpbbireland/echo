This is the final repository for all prior keyboard development code, and hardware.

Models included are: 
+ Alya: ayla80 (iso/ansi)
+ Cashel: cashel100 (ansi/iso)
+ Mioke: xpad (macro/num pad)
+ Echo: test code for RP2040 ayla80 (iso), Two versions, rgblight & rgb_matrix.

The standard keyboard code works for all, but RGB has not beed set up yet.
To put it simply, I don't know how to implement it as my attempts result in compile errors...
New vesion with RP2040 should have working RGB, awaiting [module test board](https://hackaday.io/project/198392/log/237192-rp2040-version).
