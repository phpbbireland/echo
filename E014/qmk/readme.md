# Echo EN014 Keyboard Code (June 24th)

**Copy file to: qmk_firmware/keyboards/echo/**

For via use: usevia_en014_june.json  

Compile: make echo/en014_june:via  

Copy resulting file in qmk_firmwasre directory to the Module Board (Version 2.x)  

The RGB is working but for per key, rows 2,4,6 are reversed... how do I set RGB matrix to correct this?
